## Projects 🛠️

- [InMap](https://web-production-d858.up.railway.app/) 💻 
We propose a solution for inter-mapping navigation, without the use of GPS, by utilizing QR Codes installed around the campus. Our solution, a web application, uses the QR Code scanners as checkpoints to:
Locate the current position of the user
Direct the user to the required destination through the shortest path
To achieve this, we use the **Maze-solving algorithm** to find the shortest path and we have developed an algorithm of our own. The image of the map is changed to hashes and spaces (black and white) for ease of processing by the system.

In short, our solution is a web application that helps the user to find the shortest path to the required destination, without GPS and using QR Code scanners installed around the campus as checkpoints.
